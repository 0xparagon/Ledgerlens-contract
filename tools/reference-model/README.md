# LedgerLens reference model

An independent Python model of the score contract's observable behaviour, written **only** from
[`docs/score-math.md`](../../docs/score-math.md), [`docs/interface-spec.md`](../../docs/interface-spec.md)
and the glossary. It never reads the contract source. It serves two purposes:

1. **Differential testing.** Generated operation sequences run through the model and through the real
   contract ([`driver/`](driver)), and any difference fails. That catches places where the code and
   the documentation disagree. Findings and how each was resolved are in
   [`DISAGREEMENTS.md`](DISAGREEMENTS.md).
2. **Integrator companion.** Import `ledgerlens_ref` to check your own assumptions about validation,
   decay, aggregation, hysteresis and gate decisions without running a Soroban environment.

## Covered behaviour

| Operation | Model | Contract call |
|---|---|---|
| `submit` | score/confidence range validation, hysteresis band update | `submit_score` |
| `weight`, `decay`, `floor` | pair weights, decay rate, global confidence floor | `set_pair_weight`, `set_decay_rate`, `set_global_min_confidence` |
| `get`, `eff`, `agg` | raw score, decayed effective score, weighted aggregate | `get_score`, `get_effective_score`, `get_aggregate_score` |
| `gate` | fail-closed gate with strict score check and confidence floors | `query_risk_gate_with_confidence` |

Out of scope for now: multisig/consensus, embargo, delegation, finality buffer, rate limiting.
The generator always advances past the 1-hour cooldown before submitting.

## Usage

```bash ignore
# unit tests (doc truth tables, decay/aggregate examples)
python3 -m unittest discover tools/reference-model

# differential run: build the driver, then compare
cargo build --release -p reference-model-driver
python3 tools/reference-model/run_diff.py --sequences 100000 --seed 1
```

Using the model directly:

```python
import ledgerlens_ref as ref
m = ref.Model()
m.submit(0, "XLM_USDC", 60, 90)
assert m.gate(0, "XLM_USDC", 70, 80)  # 60 < 70 and 90 >= 80
```

The nightly workflow `.github/workflows/reference-model.yml` runs 100,000 sequences with a fresh seed
each night. On a failure, the run prints the shortest failing op sequence per operation type. Record
it in `DISAGREEMENTS.md` and classify it before changing the code, the docs, or the model.
