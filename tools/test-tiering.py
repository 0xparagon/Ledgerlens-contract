"""Test-suite tiering for LedgerLens: manifest, budgets, and coverage gates.

Background (issue #1244): the workspace carries a very large test suite, spread
over ~130 `src/test_*.rs` modules in `contracts/ledgerlens-score/`, three
workspace crates of cross-contract integration tests, a few shell suites, and a
python suite.  There was no formal answer to three questions:

  1. Which tests are cheap enough to run on every push, and which are not?
  2. Does every test actually belong to some run, or can one quietly fall out of
     the suite (an undeclared `mod`, a file nobody wired up)?
  3. If a test moves from the cheap tier to the slow one, did anybody mean it?

This tool answers all three from one machine-readable manifest,
`test-tiers.toml` at the repository root:

  * every discovered test *unit* (a `#[cfg(test)]` module of a library target,
    an integration-test target, a doctest target, a shell/python suite, or a
    stray test file that belongs to no cargo target) is classified with a
    `kind` (its purpose: smoke, unit, integration, property, stress, soak,
    mutation) and a `tier` (fast / standard / nightly / disabled);
  * every execution tier has an enforced wall-clock budget;
  * `check` fails when a discovered test is missing from the manifest, when a
    manifest entry no longer matches what is on disk, when a test is classified
    but unreachable from every execution tier, or when a tier move is not
    accompanied by a review annotation;
  * `plan` turns a tier into the exact list of commands to run, and `report`
    turns the measured run into the budget/tier-move report that CI publishes.

Tiers are a partition: a test unit belongs to exactly one execution tier, and
`fast ∪ standard ∪ nightly` is exactly the set of units that are actually
compiled and run.  `disabled` is a classification, not a run: it records a test
file that exists in the tree but is not wired into any cargo target, which
requires a reason.  Pinning that state is the point — 81 of the 138
test-carrying modules in `contracts/ledgerlens-score/src/` are not declared in
`src/lib.rs`, and 87 units across the workspace have never executed, so their
tests never run.  The manifest records each of them explicitly, so the next
person to add `mod test_foo;` is forced to classify the newly-live suite, and
un-wiring a suite again fails CI.

Usage:
    python3 tools/test-tiering.py check                 # gate: manifest is complete and consistent
    python3 tools/test-tiering.py check --base main     # ... and no tier move since `main` is unreviewed
    python3 tools/test-tiering.py check --selftest      # ... and prove this checker still detects a bad manifest
    python3 tools/test-tiering.py bootstrap --write     # re-generate the unit section of the manifest
    python3 tools/test-tiering.py plan --tier fast      # print the commands for one tier
    python3 tools/test-tiering.py report --tier fast --results <tsv> --output <md>
    python3 tools/test-tiering.py selftest              # unit tests for this checker

`scripts/test-tier.sh` is the developer-facing wrapper around `plan` + `report`;
see `docs/test-tiers.md`.
